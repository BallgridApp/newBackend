# newBackend

This is the Backend API I created over the summer of my senior year in high school into college. Built with Express.JS, I connected it to Google Firestore 
and used a variety of cool technologies and tools in the process. Some of them include Postman, Algolia, Google Firebase, Expo Push Notifications, and Firebase Auth.
Code was deployed to Firebase Functions.
